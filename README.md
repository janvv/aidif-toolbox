A comprehensive set of validated models and tools to perform pre-clinical evaluation for AID systems and their components.

## Description

The AID Interoperability Framework (AIDIF) is intended to be a public, modular computational modeling and simulation environment for development and evaluation of AID systems and components. Building on over a decade of proprietary simulator development experience, AIDIF aims to integrate validated models of CGMs, insulin pumps, and control algorithms with physiological and behavioral models derived from public high quality and representative clinical data.

## Requirements and installation
It is recommended to use **MATLAB R2019b** or later.
The following MathWorks products are required:
- MATLAB
- Matlab Simulink

Users or developers who clone the repository using git can use [MatBox](https://github.com/ehennestad/MatBox) to quickly install this project's [requirements](./requirements.txt) (if any):

```matlab
AIDIFtools.installMatBox() % If MatBox is not installed
matbox.installRequirements(path/to/toolboxRootDir)
```

## Getting started

```matlab
